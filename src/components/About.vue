    <h3>Welcome to my page! </h3>
    <p> I am junior front end developer on the mission to become seasoned full-stack expert. </p>
    <p> I started writing code in 2015, while still doing my degree in Business Administration in Helsinki Business College. I started by modifying web page templates and I just got fascinated about design. </p>
    <p> My interest in digital media took me into Haaga-Helia to study Business Information Technology. Although I started, loving design and aesthetics, the more code I wrote, the more addicted I got to the problem-solving aspect of it. I startedHaaga-Helia, wanting to be a web designer, and ended it wanting to be a full stack developer. </p>
    <p> Now that I have my first half a year of industry experience under my belt, I would love to master my skills as a full stackdeveloper, to move towards new challenges in cloud services or in data analytics.</p>
